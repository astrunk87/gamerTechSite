## description
 We created this project to help gamers find reviews of gamer gear.
 With this site gamers can find reviews on all types of gamer gear, like consoles, controllers and retro consoles. They can also add their own review to the site.
 By doing this project we all gained a better understanding of whole to make a full MERN stack website. We became more familar with css, bootstrap, javascript, using the MERN stack and so much more.

## Installation
  You can choose to install this locally and run it from your computer. To do that you just need to clone the repostiory, do an npm run seed, then npm run dev. You can also follow the link to go to the live site.

## usage
  Once on the site you can add a review from the site under the console you wish to review. You can also open the Apollo client to edit the data. From Apollo you can update, delete and add reviews on consoles.
